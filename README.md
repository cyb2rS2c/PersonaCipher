## 🧠 Overview

**PersonaCipher** is a Python-based face recognition project using the `face_recognition` and `OpenCV` libraries. The application allows users to recognize faces in images and videos using a preloaded dataset of known faces.

## ✨ Features

✔️ **Recognize faces in images**

✔️ **Recognize faces in videos (MP4)**

✔️ **Auto-scale frames for fast performance**

✔️ **Auto-create datasets from usernames**

✔️ **Automatic image fetching (10 per user)**

✔️ **MP4 downloader for online videos**

✔️ **CLI interface with ASCII art banner**

✔️ **Windows & Linux compatible**

## Requirements
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: if you counter any issue with `pip`, execute this command manually:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
### Clone the repository:

For Windows using powershell (download the zip file ):
    
    curl -o PersonaCipher.zip  https://github.com/cyb2rS2c/PersonaCipher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
    Expand-Archive -Force  .\PersonaCipher.zip
    cd PersonaCipher/PersonaCipher-main

Note: you need to install the same tools on windows in order to work.

For Linux:
    
    git clone https://github.com/cyb2rS2c/PersonaCipher.git
    cd PersonaCipher
    
### 1. Prepare the Dataset
Place images of known people inside a dataset directory (default: `known_faces`). Each person's images should be inside a folder named after them. Example structure:

```
known_faces/
  ├── John_Doe/
  │   ├── img1.jpg
  │   ├── img2.jpg
  ├── Jane_Smith/
  │   ├── img1.jpg
  │   ├── img2.jpg
```

But you do not need to create it manually.
### Auto-Generate Dataset
1. Edit the names in `usernames.txt`
2. Run:
```bash
python3 create_dataset.py
```
The script will:

1. Create folders
2. Download 10 images per user
3. Build a complete dataset automatically

## Usage
### Run PersonaCipher
```bash
python3 persona_cipher.py
```
### Menu Options 
- **Recognize faces in an image**: Provide the image path when prompted.
- **Recognize faces in a video**: Provide the video file path when prompted.
- **Exit**: Close the application.

## Functionality Overview

### MP4 Downloader
Download any video URL:
```bash
python3 mp4_downloader.py
```
### `load_known_faces()`
Loads face encodings from the dataset directory and stores them for recognition.

### `recognize_faces_in_image()`
- Detects and recognizes faces in a provided image.
- Draws a rectangle around recognized faces and labels them.

### `recognize_faces_in_video()`
- Processes frames from a video file.
- Detects and recognizes known faces in real-time.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels recognized faces.
  
### Dataset Generator
```bash
python3 create_dataset.py
```

## Notes
- Uses HOG-based face detection
- Threshold for matching: 0.6
- Works on both Linux and Windows
- Avoid noisy datasets for best recognition
- Press q to exit video mode
