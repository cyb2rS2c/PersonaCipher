**The program is designed to recognize and match faces based on a pre-existing dataset. Once a person's face is trained and stored in the dataset, the system can identify them during future scans.
For example, if you train the program with a photo of someone, like Lionel Messi, the system will store Messi's facial features. Later, if you present a new image or even a video of Messi, the system will recognize and match the face to the trained dataset.**
